GDD Proj1B Ideas:

2 new enemies-
	*A ranged enemy that shoots projectiles at you if you get close enough
	*A scaled up boss enemy similar to default enemy but also maybe with shooting mechanics

2 new items-
	*A medkit or something that heals
	*A shield that blocks incoming damage

2 new abilities-
	*An enraged mode where you can deal more damage but also take more damage
	*A magic spell that shoots projectiles at enemies

2 new UI elements: 
	*Maybe cooldown indicators for the abilities?

2 new levels:
	*A level with predominantly ranged enemies
	*A level with the boss enemy
